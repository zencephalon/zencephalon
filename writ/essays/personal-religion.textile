h1. Personal Ethical Religion

I want a code of ethics. Unfortunately, none of the mainstream codes fit me. Some of the traditions I've investigated are (in order of ascending preference) Mormonism, Catholicism, Lutheranism, Hinduism, Buddhism, and Daoism. Each has many positive aspects I incorporated into my life, but none of them could I follow fully. If I declared myself to 'belong' to any of them, I would open myself up to criticism of their worst aspects.

I realized to keep all the tenants of a religion I must agree with those tenants. I haven't found a religion I completely agree with. Perhaps there is one. If you think I might like a religion, please suggest it to me (let me know what books and resources I should begin my investigations with). In the mean time, I will make a Personal Religion that I will have no trouble following. I believe that Personal Religion allows me to be a good person without dogmatism.

My Personal Ethical Religion has a couple tenants and many conducts. 

My tenants
0. I am sacred and free.
1. In relation to others I must conduct myself.

Tenants aren't very interesting to me. Conducts are more important, so here they are.
