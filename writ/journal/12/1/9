So I'm trying to be consistent about using the computer as my means of information storage. I do feel as though the right hemisphere of thought is somewhat restricted here, due to the relative lack of free space.

I had an idea for how to organize my mind, however. I will represent the structure of it as a tree.

The development of the mind would be organic. 

Say at the root of the tree I had the statement

I am Matthias Bundai and this is my zencephalon.

this mysterious concept I am still trying to crystalize

Like a king I must continually circuit the borders of my empire.

Build structure out of links, storage knowledge in heaps. Add all leaves to the queue and circulate it. Place issues on the stack.

Seems like using the linux filesystem and git is not a bad way of storing the tree.
