Well, I'm on the flight to HMMT now. That should be a blast. This is the second flight, that is, because we transfered at Milwaukee. Now, I'm wondering, should I begin that other story of mine now? Or should I wait for a bit before I start? That might be a good idea. 

I'm not sure at the moment what I should do. Perhaps I should begin working on the stylesheet for Waylaid.org's CraftyCritiquer.
