Wow. My busmate has really made herself out to be an incredibly tasteless person now. First she was reading that stupid book about linking autism to immune shots. Which is total bullshit, as I'm sure I don't need to tell you. And this is especially unfortunate because she is pregnant, so, looks like her kid is going to have some fun catching diseases everyone else is immune to.

And then. And then she picked up Eclipse and started reading it. Fuck.
