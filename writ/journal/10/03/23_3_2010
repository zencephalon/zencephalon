Right, so last night I had some ideas about revising the story.

First off, I should use Bernard as a device more. "You should keep your eyes on him, then, because he has eyes for you." 

I can eliminate the use of the too obvious prompts from Aliza by making Chris sell his reluctance better. He should go back to stacking books until Aliza presses him, duh. 

Am I going deaf? I certainly hope not. But the bus rides have a lot more ambient noise than I am usually used to.
