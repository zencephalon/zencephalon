Dear Journal,

I have no idea quite what I am doing, except I do know that I want to live life remembering every moment as well as I can, and really focusing on the present. I think the Buddhist way of life (that is, the one advocated by Buddha) is a good way to live. 

I figure there are some things I should do every day, but I do need to plan them out carefully now. These things include...
1. Meditation
2. Exercise
3. Chores
4. Homework

I should figure out a sort of consistent schedule for when I work on a class, and how much work I do. I think if I were to do an hour of work per day on every class that would be more than enough work for me to breeze through the semester. I don't know about using this keyboard down here, because it does make a lot of noise, relative to what my netbook keyboard makes. So I'm not sure if I will continue taking it with me to use. My backpack is pretty heavy as it is, and I don't need the burden of carrying this with me. Particularly, since I don't know if being transported like this is any good for the keyboard. It probably isn't any good for the keyboard, when you really good at it. 

So I'm a little confused now. What ever happened to working on the online version of DeftDraft? I guess we just forgot about it? That doesn't seem quite right. We should work on something similar. Maybe not right now. Right now let's just focus on what is important, and that is school. I don't know, I think I might put this keyboard away now, I don't think the increase in noise is worth whatever increase in typig satisfaction I might be enjoying. I should probably move my computer upstairs and get a wireless adapter for it. That would be very nice.

So what's the matter?
