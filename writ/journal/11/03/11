Cool. Today's journal is being written in C/Draft. That's right, I finally did it. Wrote this crazy C/Draft thing, which I still have a lot of work to do for. Nice, so this works now. 

The funny thing is, I can't make a screenshot of using CDraft right now, because I don't want to make a screenshot of my journal.

Here we go. I was just thinking to myself, the reason this day has been such a success is that I got past my perfectionism, and was able to just push out this awesome text editor. I can't wait to see what I can do next, now that I am feeling more and more liberated to pursue what I want to do.

I'm finally going to get the Spring break that I've really always wanted. A week alone where I can work on whatever I please, all to myself. Of course, I do still have homework to do over spring break, so that's not entirely free.
