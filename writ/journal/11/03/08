Technically I'm writing this on the 9th, but I'm up really late tonight. All of a sudden, programming is becoming way more interesting again, probably just because I'm doing it again. The more I learn about anything, the more interesting it becomes, I guess. That makes a lot of sense.

Well, I didn't go to class today, but I got a lot of other things done, like building a desk, cleaning up the entire room, etc. I'm also resisting the urge to play Dragon Age 2 as best I can right now. I think I will be able to, if all goes well, since Han Zhe plays it so much anyway.
