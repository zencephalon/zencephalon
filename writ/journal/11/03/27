Wow, today was just too annoying. I actually can't believe what a pain in the ass this whole process has been. I mean, really. Why does Medtronic think that every employee has to be drug tested anyway? And why does it have to be such a pain in the ass? And how come they gave me such a short amount of time to respond to the job offer? Either they are trying to make it so that I can't get offers from other companies, or the company itself is fucked up in some way that would require me to respond so early, either way, things are fucked.

It was such a pain in the ass to get the urine ready and everything too, so I can't believe how much of a waste it is going to be in the end. I mean, this pee that I have in the bag is probably wasted. I'm going to need to prepare this whole arrangement again tomorrow if I decide then. But really, I'm not sure I want to go through with this at all, I mean, I could make just as much money producing things on my own.
