I have too long called myself a writer without writing. This is lying. I do not want to lie. Writing is a self-evident technique, which I hope to gainfully employ from this time on.

Writing is a powerful tool. As such, it must be wielded with great responsibility. Do I have the responsbility to wield such powers? I believe I do, but the question merits investigation.

Who am I, and what do I believe?

It is difficult to define in words what I am right now. This is beyond my own current comprehension. I can define what conducts I wish to maintain.

The word 'conduct' is significant. I will not limit myself in any realm of my own dominion. In my interactions with others I will follow the codes of non-interference and mutual-benefit.
