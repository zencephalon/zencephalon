Truly life is getting better every day. And even in those days where it doesn't get better, I have an opportunity for learning. I'm just so eternally grateful that I have experienced the things I have so that I'm able to live out my life fully as I was always meant to.

This is probably the best thing ever. Adn I really love typing on this keyboard, because I know that I can just dance my fingers over the keys, and it will just cause the words to flow out. I should try to approach typing with the same ease and grace that my mother brings to piano. She's just so wonderful at piano now, I think. I haven't actually heard her play yet, but I can't wait.
