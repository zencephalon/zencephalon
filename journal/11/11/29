Alright, since I'm not using my time very well right now, I might as well do something that I enjoy instead of just moping about. And I definitely do enjoy writing, although I never make enough time for it. That is to say, I don't choose to write with enough regularity. It has been a while since my last journal entry, and that is my fault of course. I have been up to a lot of nothing. Well, I've been doing some things. Formulating a lot of theories on life based on taoism. But the most important thing is just to try and live that life out. I will eventually write a book called The Source: A Hacker's Path Through Life, which will explain some of the realizations I've come through and include ways that people can improve their own lives using the techniques that I've found helpful.
I need to work on this black footed ferret powerpoint slide. I'm not sure what my hang up is here, I guess I just don't want to sit down and do the planning work, and I also just don't enjoy using the sofyware right now. Both of which are silly reservations of course, because every challenge is an pooportunity to improve. I just wish there were a better way of giving presentations than powerpoint. Actually, come to think of it, there certinaly are, we just aren't able to use them for this, because this is for a class where they want to minimize their own difficulties.
So I ought to get writing this reality experience machine short story so that I can have it finished in time to be published in the ivory tower, if they happen to like it. 
I wonder why I have so much resistance to work sometimes. I really wonder where that arose from. I mean, it's just unnatural how much I will do to avoid doing some work.
