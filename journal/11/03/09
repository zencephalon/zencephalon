Nice! I just wrote my journal command, and it works perfectly. I could not have asked for a better experience with it. Also, not only did I just create a kickass.

It's so cool to be able to just type in 'journal' now and be brougt automatically to the right journal entry. 

I'm considering just modifying Pyroom and turning it into C/Draft, but that has a number of undesirable effects, such as being difficult to install for the time being. But I'm sure if I worked more in Python, then I would be able to figure those things out. And really, I think realistically, the text editor is something that really only I will use very much, since it is so very, very strange to use.

I think I am doing to do that, then. I should write that down somewhere in the plans directory.

I have this sick feeling that the only reason I am up so late is because I drank that one stupid can of Mountain Dew. Someone on reddit said that stopping his consumption of any pop was one of the best life style changes he has ever made. He said it improved his sleep and his complexion and all these other things. I can believe that.

I've often worried that I'm getting less intelligent. I seemed to have piqued in my mathematics ability at a young age certainly. I'm not sure, I am just filled with existential anxiety at my age.

Man, I really just need to go to bed. My fucking arm hurts right now. But I have to say, Georgia at 14 pt just looks gorgeous right now. And the Pyroom theme I have going is based on the golden ratio, so it is very calming.
