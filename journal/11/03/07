Last night I did a lot of stuff. I investigated using FUSE to create a new filesystem that would better suite the reorganization that I'm doing of my home directory. I don't think that creating the file system is absolutely necessary though, it just feels like one of my usual delay tactics I use. Whenever I want to do something, I create an enormously difficult programming project in its place.

It's possible that I should be taking notes on class right now, because it is pretty important to get into the good habits of typing notes. But I really don't want to tonight, because I'm still getting organized. I really do want to turn my life around though, there is no reason why I shouldn't be utilizing my brain power better. The last semester I basically squandered my mind as best I could. That was a mistake, for certain.

Heh, I'm pretty high right now, but I think that is fine. I can function pretty well when I'm high, surprisingly. I am also typing pretty well right now, really jamming on the keys.
