Alright, it took me a damn long time to get to this, but I'm finally journaling. First I had to make sure that Black Sands by Bonobo was readied.

Last night was a really stressful one. Mom and dad got into another weird fight, and I ended up crying a lot. I realized a few things though. First off, weed is really expensive, and I need to quit it. Second off, I need to get my life together, in terms of school, so I can be assured that my scholarships continue. I need to create an ultimate schedule that I can follow every day so that I get all my work done and still have time to goof around in the evening. This really shouldn't be too hard, as long as I'm not an idiot.

Whether I am an idiot or not is subject to much debate. For one thing, CDraft ended up not being that amazing, but that's because I need to add a lot more commands to make it useful, like redo-word and redo-sentence. Okay, actually, I think we can add those right away.
