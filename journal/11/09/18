Sometimes I really have to wonder what the hell I am doing with my life. I know for a fact that playing video games is a waste of time. It's just like depositing my time into something that won't amount to anything. I shoud spend my time improving my writing skills, because honestly, when I hear myself speak these days, I don't sound like the intelligent articulate young man I want to be. I sound like someone who has a lot of verbal clutter in my thought and speech.

So you ever have one of those days when nothing seems to be colorful? Well, I'm having one right now, but I'm trying to cope with it. I think it would be pretty cool to make music using a program, so I'm working on that. Generating a story using a computer would be a lot more difficult, so I'm working on this first. I don't know about you, but I think music is one of the coolest things there is, so I think I would be a happy if I tried my hand at that.

ChucK is pretty cool. I think that I could make some cool music with it, although I don't really know much music theory or synth stuff. I would really be learning a lot by trying to use it.

Roadmap for a better life:
dual n back
meditation
lucid dreaming

Hm, you know, the best way to get motivated to write is to read, but I don't really read all that much fiction any more. It's really a pity.
