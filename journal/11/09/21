So I seriously think that this netbook might make a more overall positive contribution to my life if I weren't able to access the internet, because that way I could use it for creative expression more than time wasting. However, the usefulness of having it have a webbrowser is impossible for me to deny, so I probably won't be taking such drastic action. I just need to apply more mindfulness to my life so that I don't get meanlessly distracted right away when I get on the computer.
