I'm not entirely sure what the problem is, but lately I've been relapsing into not being mindful. I think that being around other people has always just been too distracting for me. I'm never able to turn people down when they want to have fun. This is my own weakness, to be sure.

I'm convinced that I need a daily schedule, and reminders to stay mindful. Eventually staying mindful will it's own reminder, I'm sure.

Now, I would like to exercise, but I don't know if that is possible without being able to eat properly. I'm definitely not eating properly. 

Getting up at 5 or 6 would be pretty useful. I'd have a few hours to myself where I could get homework done without being distracted by whatever is happening. Of course, this would mean I have to go to bed early and miss out on the fun happening in the evening, but you know, as much as I wait in anticipation for these things they aren't that satisfying when I actually get down to it. That's just like my experience with 2C-E, I had really made a big deal out of certain ideas, but they just fell completely flat, meanwhile, when I was mindful it was just the greatest trip ever. So I should focus on being mindful all the time.
