Whew, well, I'm sure relieved that my norwegian interview is over. I think it went alright. Obviously I messed up a few times, but these things never go as smoothly as you plan. Which is why I'm glad that I didn't create too much stress for myself over this. I've just got to take the same approach for this computer science and history tests I've got coming up. Prepare, but don't stress out. Stress is just an epic way for people to create their own suffering, and I'm not going to be a part of it. 

Man, I really should work on this stupid idea I have for writing faster. I don't need the whole thing, but being able to backspace by pressing space would be so great though. You could write so quickly if you could just delete words at a time.

Seriously, what the fuck am I doing? I cannot concentrate to study for this test right now. What I really need to do is focus on right now.
