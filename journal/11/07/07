Most people's difficulty with mathematics is learned helplessness. 

There are a lot of things I have to avoid like learned helplessness, self-serving bias, self handicapping, using the availability heuristic, the splotlight effect, etc.

There are some effects I can take advantage of, such as embodied cognition, and cult formation.

Watch out for confirmation bias and extinction bursts too.

Use anchoring to influence people's decisions.
