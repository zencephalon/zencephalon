Well, today was another one of _those_ nights. I was an hour and a half late for my CSCI4041 test. Since the test was only two hours long, this was a problem. However, I still managed to answer about 80 points worth of questions, so take that as you will. Now, the problem is this caused a lot of tension in the family, and dad ended up yelling for a good portion of the evening.
The worst part about growing up in an unstable household is just how lonely it is. There's no one to talk to about it. They can't relate, and it just makes me feel ashamed. I always feel far older than people who are my same age. They just don't understand, they've had such sheltered lives. I'm sure by some standards I've had a very easy life too, but still. The difference in outlooks is huge.
