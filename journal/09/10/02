I have a lot of writing projects to do, but I haven't really been writing at them. I guess the act of writing is a self-sustaining activity, except you really have to get it started, first. I guess that's why I'm writing this shit right here. Just a way for me to get the act started. Today's art class was interesting, I guess. I don't know how I really feel about having to write about a piece there. None of the particular pieces was that inspiring. Except maybe the walk in exhibit. That hall way with the sloping perspective is pretty funky. You could base so pretty cool stuff off that. The story I really want to write right now is "River of Fire", which was inspired by imagery I noticed walking outside in the rain to the bus.
