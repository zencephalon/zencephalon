Hell, I probably should have brought some homework with me to do. I definitely have stuff due next week, so even though I cleared out everything I could do before I left for HMMT, that stuff has rebuilt itself, so I'm sure to have homework due.

That's annoying, because I'm currently stuck at the airport with absolutely nothing to do. Nothing, that is, besides sitting here and typing.

So you know how people talk about lifestyle businesses like they are a bad thing? Well, screw that. I'm going to build a lifestyle business, so I can spend all my life traveling and not give a shit about everything else. 

I just need someone who is willing to fly all around the world and act as a traveling salesman. Except it'll be better than that, sort of, because it is like perpetual vacation, the way I have it planned.

Man, I really need to get a pair of earbuds that isn't a piece of crap. That would be very nice. I should be able to use that Amazon order money to do that already, because it would be really nice to be able to listen to music again.

I wonder when I will be picked up from the airport. I'm not really sure what they are planning as far as that goes. Am I actually going to get picked up from the airport, or will I have to take the lightrail to the U of MN? One annoying thing is that the lightrail doesn't stop exactly at the U, so I'd have to bus over even.

Meh. Also, I was not too impressed with MIT. It seems like the students there are very prone to making poor lifestyle decisions, and other fun things like that. In general, they are the kind of people who would end up exasperating the fuck out of me, so I don't think I could stand to go there for four years. That would be pretty obnoxious.
