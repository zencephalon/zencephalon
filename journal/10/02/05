One always hopes that the passing of days will bring warm cheer, and not the chill awareness of mortality. That ticking sensation does nothing but bitter the sweetness of companionship with thoughts of impermenance. But there's no avoiding Death's taut wire wrapped about our hearts. With each moment he reels us in closer, bit by bit. And we don't know to start clinging until it's too late. Only in our old age do we begin to value all that we had, as we are pulled away. What's to be done when we can no longer hope? Only allow ourselves to be drawn, up, up, into the sky and through the clouds and through space, towards our very own star, and fade into the night of memory.
But damn, that was depressing and shit. Let's go be promiscuous and forget about all that. What's a fling in light of everything else? You're a pretty young lady, and I'm... well, I'm a chap, so let's go. We'll forget about our inhabitions and live in merryment. Until we find out you are pregnant, and then the crushing weight of being responsible for a child's life comes crashing on our backs.

God, what is dad still doing here anyway?

Well, the idea is that 

Adrian wants to marry <female name>, but her brother is vehemently against the idea. Adrian's friend Bart (for now) asks what would happen if it came to a duel. Would Adrian actually accept a dual? Bart has a hidden agenda, because he too is in love with <female>. Adrian insists that he would enter a duel for the hand of <female>, and Bart tries to convince him this would be folly. 

Basically:

Bart agitates a duel. Bart poisons brother so he loses the duel. 

Hm, maybe instead of brother it should be some other suitor.
