Norwegian vowels->vokalene can be tricky, there are some new ones.

In Norwegian each vowel can be long->lang. Generally, if a vowel is followed
by two consonants->konsonantene then it is short->kort. If a vowel is followed
by only one consonant then it is usually long.

  Short Long
a katt  tak
e legge lege
i inne  mine
o rom   Polen
u Unni  bus
y fylle by
æ færre fæl
ø øst   øve
å åtte  Åse

Sometimes the letter 'o' is pronounced as 'å' as in 'komme', 'sommer'.
Sometimes the letter 'u' is pronounced as 'o' as in 'ung', 'tung', 'dum'.
