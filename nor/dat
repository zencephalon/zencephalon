Why learn Norwegian? Norwegian is spoken in Norway, which is a very cool
country. Norwegian is also mutually intelligible with Swedish and Danish. So
you get three languages in one, so speak. It is also highly similar to English
and German, so the learning curve is gentle if you know English or German.
