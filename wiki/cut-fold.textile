Identity, cut, fold, choice are sufficient for programming.

identity:
0 -> 0
Identity is the base unit of information

cut:
(0) -> 1

The cut represents a dimension of time/computation. () is basically a quote operation that delays computation.
You can derive the integers from this. This is just the Church-Numeral or Peano-Arithmetic.
((0)) -> 2
(((0))) -> 3

fold:
x,y 0 -> x
x,y 1 -> y

From this you can get space and rationals.
(0),((0)) -> 1/2
((0)),(((0))) -> 2/3

choice:
(x):() -> x
(x):,0 -> 0
x,y:0
