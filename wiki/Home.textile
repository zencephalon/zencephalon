This wiki doesn't have much yet, but I challenge you to fill it with excellent information. Primarily I will be using this Wiki as an external brain/data-store. That knowledge is power, so use it wisely. ;-)

Some recent developments include:
[[VRU]]: meta-fictional scenario exploring virtual reality technology and its implications for conscious beings
[[CS]]: computer science goodness
[[Anonymous 01]]: a biography of one of the content authors here
