1. Finish school

Not necessarily with a degree.

2. Be mindful

I still spend large portions of the day unaware of what I'm really doing.

3. Apply the utmost of my learning to all aspect of living

Most of what I've "learned" in the past I've never made use of.

4. Make the world a better place

Little bit by bit.
