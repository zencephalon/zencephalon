The comment describing poker-style mindgames is by far the most interesting part

3 hours agoMatthew Bunday
yeah, I thought so too
I can see queen-duels becoming so intense
they already are in normal chess

3 hours agoJoshua Orion Skylar Hickman
I've got a feeling just about every part of this game will be bluffs on top of bluffs

3 hours agoMatthew Bunday
yes
the only way to capture the king seems to be to trick them into moving somewhere they don't think you will be
adding the dimension of a clock is interesting too

3 hours agoJoshua Orion Skylar Hickman
then it's basically street fighter

3 hours agoMatthew Bunday
I was unsure about whether the players should be able to see when one person has stopped the clock
simulchess basically does become street fighter without the emphasis on raw reaction time and finger execution
but there's a lot of strategy with the clock. Like if we say your clock stops whenever you submit a final move
with public clocks, the other player might spend longer
knowing you've locked into a move
I'm not sure
depends on how people want to use that resource I guess

2 hours agoJoshua Orion Skylar Hickman
I think the clocks get complicated fast
my instincts say you should be able to change your move if you pay the clock cost from when you selected to when you changed
which means people can do move arbitrage

2 hours agoMatthew Bunday
ooh
that's a cool idea
playing a little against myself, I wonder if this simultaneous move idea needs at least a modified version of chess
oh also, I guess pieces can swap position?

2 hours agoJoshua Orion Skylar Hickman
yep
on both

2 hours agoMatthew Bunday
it's weird when you have pawns phase through each other

2 hours agoJoshua Orion Skylar Hickman
pawns currently can kill themselves by moving where they can't capture

2 hours agoMatthew Bunday
hm

2 hours agoJoshua Orion Skylar Hickman
which I like

2 hours agoMatthew Bunday
ok, that's a good idea

2 hours agoJoshua Orion Skylar Hickman
but is confusing a little

2 hours agoMatthew Bunday
because the pawns have been a tricky issue
I'm not sure what the best resolution is
probably just to have a variant where none of the pieces have different movement and capture moves

2 hours agoJoshua Orion Skylar Hickman
the programmer in me says to resolve it in a way that isn't complex as all hell

2 hours agoMatthew Bunday
yeah
Maybe pawns can move in any of the three spaces in front?

2 hours agoJoshua Orion Skylar Hickman
or only diagonally, maybe?
only forward doesn't le them do anything interesting

2 hours agoMatthew Bunday
only diagonal would change all the openings quite a bit
I guess you can advance two side by side pawns forward

2 hours agoJoshua Orion Skylar Hickman
I'm thinking letting them do diagonals at all accomplishes that

2 hours agoMatthew Bunday
so you can still get to the position of two pawns from the middle getting to d4 and d5 lol

2 hours agoJoshua Orion Skylar Hickman
okay, how about, pawns can move same as original -- where there was a pawn diagonally or forward
no difference between move and capture rules after that
?

2 hours agoMatthew Bunday
could you restate that, I'm not sure I grok it

2 hours agoJoshua Orion Skylar Hickman
then pawns can phase through each other
so, if there's a pawn there now, you can move a pawn diagonally to attack
the attack fails if he also moves, possibly attacking you, which causes them to phase through each other

2 hours agoMatthew Bunday
hm
another weird case to consider

2 hours agoJoshua Orion Skylar Hickman
I like the game theory of it

2 hours agoMatthew Bunday
is say you have a rook trying to get from a1 to a8
and a piece moves into a5
does the rook get blocked?

2 hours agoJoshua Orion Skylar Hickman
I don't see why

2 hours agoMatthew Bunday
then we can do cool stuff like pawns jumping in front of the king to take a bullet
which is awesome

2 hours agoJoshua Orion Skylar Hickman
lol, yes, but simultaneous means at the same time
no rule saying the pawn gets in place before the attack
strictly speaking, we could do arbitrary animations of pieces moving and never run into trouble with interference

2 hours agoMatthew Bunday
ok, but do we allow rooks to try to move past a pawn on the assumption the pawn might move?
all the pieces could get teleportation ala the knight

2 hours agoJoshua Orion Skylar Hickman
the main issue is, what happens if they get it wrong
because I can't think of something that couldn't be leveraged into being too useful

2 hours agoMatthew Bunday
I think the normal chess board might have too many pieces
we might want to start with just two kings and add pieces we think will be interesting
and maybe start kings in corners or some such
a king with a rook, a bishop, and a queen is a damn intense game already

2 hours agoJoshua Orion Skylar Hickman
yeah, with 16 pieces I get the sense that my brain can't handle all of them at once

2 hours agoMatthew Bunday
yeah
it's the same problem I had with simultaneous go. it was just too big of a problem

2 hours agoJoshua Orion Skylar Hickman
simultaneous go on a 5x5 might be a good place to start

2 hours agoMatthew Bunday
true true
hm.
go does have some nice properties
for this sort of thing

2 hours agoJoshua Orion Skylar Hickman
okay, so the more I think about it, the more I think simulchess shouldn't have speculative moves

2 hours agoMatthew Bunday
I like that all the strategies are emergent properties
the possibility of a rook moving through a piece on the possibility that the piece will move?

2 hours agoJoshua Orion Skylar Hickman
yeah, you can use it to probe too easily
move as far into a space as they let you
which is too good
or your piece dies, which sucks too much

2 hours agoMatthew Bunday
I've thought about the probing... the cool thing is anything they can do you can too, BUT that still might be too weird/risky

2 hours agoJoshua Orion Skylar Hickman
it does impose a cost for predictability
which might be good
also makes the programming easier
I'll make sure that piece is pluggable, I guess
I get the feeling I'm going to think a bit more about archetecture before starting

2 hours agoMatthew Bunday
cool
I think I'll sketch out a quick small simulgo
because I do think using a smaller board will help clarify some issues

2 hours agoJoshua Orion Skylar Hickman
cool cool
I'm having a hard time playing out a go scenario that leads to captures at all
it all depends on what happens when two players try to play the same space

2 hours agoMatthew Bunday
my rule set so far has been to make that square gray and treat it as empty but impossible to move onto
like a dead zone from nuclear fallout

2 hours agoJoshua Orion Skylar Hickman
yeah, that's one of the scenarios where I just keep routing around points until I reach the edge of the board or decide to go for someplace else
but I'm not good at normal go, so who knows if that's what would happen

2 hours agoMatthew Bunday
that's the same problem I have. once I've coded it I need to actually find a good go player and get his strategic thoughts
I'm awful at normal go compared to anyone who actually plays it

2 hours agoJoshua Orion Skylar Hickman
So I'll grab chess, you doing go?

2 hours agoMatthew Bunday
yes
